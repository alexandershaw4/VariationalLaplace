# VariationalLaplace.jl

**Bayesian Variational Inference for Nonlinear Dynamical Systems in Julia**

This package implements an extended **Variational Laplace** routine for parameter inference in nonlinear models, including support for:

- **Thermodynamic integration** for accurate model evidence estimation
- **Low-rank covariance structure** for scalable inference
- **Adaptive noise modeling** (heteroscedastic variance)
- Flexible support for arbitrary model functions

Originally developed for use in computational neuroscience, this general-purpose inference engine can be used in any context where you want to infer latent parameters from noisy observations generated by a nonlinear forward model.
